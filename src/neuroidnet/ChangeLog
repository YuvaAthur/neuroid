	* scripts/preamble.bsh (Repository): Polished the statistic
	collection scripts. Ready to collect statistics.

2002-11-17  Cengiz Gunay  <cengiz@ull.edu>

	* scripts/stats.bsh (Repository): Fixed bug with not releasing
	resources in sequential simulations.

	* scripts/testSegregation.bsh (Repository): runs multiple
	simulations for getting segregation parameter profiles.

2002-10-29  Cengiz Gunay  <cengiz@ull.edu>

	* ntr/Peripheral.java (Repository): Is now textually Expressive.

	* phasesegregator (Repository): Added StaticticalInputSequence for
	collecting statistical info by presenting randomly selected
	objects to the network.

	* scripts (Repository): Added new bsh scripts for collecting
	statistical info. Still needs better plots, i.e. an errorplot
	class.

2002-10-12  Cengiz Gunay  <cengiz@ull.edu>

	* ntr/Shell.java (Message): Added new starting point to bootstrap
	BeanShell with appropriate environment to call simulation
	commands.

2002-10-10  Cengiz Gunay  <cengiz@ull.edu>

	* phasesegregator (Repository): Added simpler test-beds (with two
	level intermediate areas) for investigation of phase segregation
	failure. Apparently caused by appearance of spurious concept early
	in the hierarchy.

	* ntr/ModeProfile.java (Repository): Updated profiles to give
	sufficient information.

	* ntr/SRMNeuroid.java (Repository): Fixed important bug which
	stopped weights from changing in learning.

2002-05-18  Cengiz Gunay  <cengiz@ull.edu>

	* ntr/SRMNeuroid.java (Repository): Spin-off from former neuroid that keeps 
	everything that is specific to the SRM.

	* ntr/PeakerNeuroid.java (Repository): New neuroid with real continuous state
	machine that controls the discrete state machine in the SRMNeuroid. It's based
	on observing the derivative of the membrane potential.

	* scripts (Repository): Improved the way to keep watched neuroid information
	over multiple runs of the simulation.

	* ntr/NeuroidName.java (Repository): Identifying name of a neuroid in a network
	without the neuroid itself. Used for invariant representation of neuroids between
	different simulation runs.

	* ntr/Neuroid.java (Repository): Is now an abstract class for neuroids in general.
	Previous contents moved to new class SRMNeuroid.

	* ntr/AdThNeuroid.java (Repository): Experimental attempt for a dynamic threshold
	neuroid. Its failure resulted in the PeakerNeuroid.

	* ntr/Area.java (Repository): Takes a parameter on which neuroids to instantiate.

2002-05-02  Cengiz Gunay  <cengiz@ull.edu>

	* ntr/Expressive.java (Repository): Changed entity names to conform to new
	Expressive interface. Shortened names to look good on dumps and plots. 

	* ntr (Message): Removed subpackage plots to outside of this project:
	edu.ull.cgunay.utils.plots

	* (Repository): Removed neuroidnet.ntr.plots and neuroidnet.utils package to
	external project edu.ull.cgunay.utils.

2002-04-24  Cengiz Gunay  <cengiz@ull.edu>

	* utils (Repository): Improved documentation and made major changes in Iteration and 
	StringTask. This package should be moved out of neuroidnet since they are independent of 
	the neuroidal simulator.

	* ntr/plots (Repository): Fixed bugs with ranges, etc. Refined plots, enabled multiple 
	windows. Need to move this package out of neuroidnet.

	* ntr/WeightedPotentialPlot.java (Repository): new plot for potential plot with
	weight profile.

	* ntr/PotentialPlot.java (Repository): new plot for raw potential plot of a synapse.

	* ntr/MembranePotentialPlot.java (Repository): new plot for total neuroid potential.

2002-04-15  Cengiz Gunay  <cengiz@ull.edu>

	* ntr/plots (Repository): Grapher independent plotting system. Second revision.
	Still needs improvement by adding new graphs. Currently supports spike and
	profile plots.

	* scripts (Repository): Contains BeanShell scripts that aid simulation of the network.

2002-04-11  Cengiz Gunay  <cengiz@ull.edu>

	* utils/StringTask.java (Repository): New Task to make easier iteration tasks
	that need to accumulate a string value that will eventually be returned.

	* ntr (Repository): Added a new way to record changes and provide offline 
	visualization of this information. See new package neuroidnet.ntr.plots.

2002-03-24  Cengiz Gunay  <cengiz@ull.edu>

	* neuroidnet (Repository): New base package "neuroidnet". Subpackages are also updated.
	
	* ntr (Repository): Changed package name to "neuroidnet.ntr"
	Changed AxonArbor to attach itself to its srcNeuroid. Various funcs
	in Area no longer returns AxonArbor.
	Area.axons is now a Vector of AxonArbors. Still needs to be correctly
	treated by Area.fire()

2002-03-05  Cengiz Gunay  <cengiz@ull.edu>

	* PhaseSegregator/Peripheral.java (Repository): Uses the new Peripheral.

	* PhaseSegregator/Network.java (Repository): Uses the new Network.

	* Base/Neuroid.java (Repository): Serializable. Added controls and printouts for finding
	the bug.

	* Base/Peripheral.java (Repository): Serializable. Changed structure.

	* Base/Network.java (Repository): Serializable. New functions and interface. Changed
	the way Network is instantiated and interacts with Peripheral.

	* Base/DebuggerInterface.java (Repository): New for operations from BeanShell.

2001-09-22  Cengiz Gunay  <cengiz@ull.edu>

	* PhaseSegregator/Network.java (Repository): Now can control nuBoost parameter for
	increased probability of connection between areas. Any concept saturated will
	raise an exception. Not tested.

	* TODO (Repository): added near future changes to make.
