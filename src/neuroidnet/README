Requirements:
--------------------

I'm including a few compilation instructions to help you:

1) It will save you a lot of time if you install the Apache Ant
   compilation tool (http://ant.apache.org/). Neuroidnet comes with a
   build.xml file for Ant.

2) You'll need to install the BeanShell framework (http://beanshell.org/)
   source code to compile and run the Neuroidal Network simulator. It may
   also require minor modification of the BeanShell code: making the
   bsh.CommandLineReader class public. Make them accessible using the CLASSPATH
   variable.

3) Install my JavaUtils package (http://cengique.2y.net/~cengiz/javautils.jar) 
   and make it accessible on the Java CLASSPATH, or simply copy it to the 
   classes/ subdirectory within this package.
	       
Compiling and building distributions:
-------------------------------------
Run "ant -projecthelp" to see available build targets.

* Running "ant" alone or with "ant build" would compile the Neuroidnet simulator.
* Running "ant dist" first builds and then creates a class Jar file.
* Running the "./makedoc" script creates the html documentation 
   (need to change the parameters before running)

Quick start guide:
--------------------

run:

	java neuroidnet.ntr.Shell -c

to get a BeanShell interface with the simulation commands pre-loaded from an
initialization file. See the javadoc for the neuroidnet.ntr.Shell class for more
info. See http://beanshell.org for using BeanShell.
