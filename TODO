? do something about too many updates to the algorithm
- parallelize (RMI)
- solve problem with constant current
- enable selection of inhibitory connections and other parameters
- set global inhibitory connections
+ add deltaT to Area and use if in algo.s et al.
+ Visualize somehow
+ Give inputs
+ determine constants and run test
+ Complete period calculation in Neuroid.updateWeights()
