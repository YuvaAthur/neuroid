    <title>Overview of the Neuroidal Network Project</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    Implementation of Valiant's Neuroidal model for a biologically motivated neural network
    and artificial intelligence system. 
    <p> Design is augmented by use of the Spike Response Model (SRM) of Gerstner for spike behavior of individual neurons [Gerstner, 99]. Additional improvements include synchronized and oscillatory behavior as observed in neuronal populations.<p>
