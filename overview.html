  <body>
    Implementation of Valiant's Neuroidal model for a biologically motivated neural network
    and artificial intelligence system. 
    <p> Design is augmented by usage of the Pulsed Neural Networks for spike behavior of individual neurons. Additional improvements include synchronized and oscialltory behavior as observed in neuron populations.
